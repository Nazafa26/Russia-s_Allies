In this project, we show how to clean data and do visualization in Jupyter note book. Matplotlib and Seaborn are python libraries that are used for data visualization. They have inbuilt modules for plotting different graphs. While Matplotlib is used to embed graphs into applications, Seaborn is primarily used for statistical graphs.
